# Text-Image-to-Audio-Conversion-using-Python

A beginner project in python language which can convert text image to text and then convert it to audio. It can read text Images both in real time and from saved images.
Here I used Python-tesseract as an optical character recognition (OCR) tool, Tkinter for the GUI.

The code is linux environment based.
